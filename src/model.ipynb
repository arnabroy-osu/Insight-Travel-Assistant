A \\n$100 item will therefore \\ncost you around $109 ($100 \\n+ 9%).\\nTIPPING\\nPrices indicated in \\nrestaurants do not include \\ntaxes or tip.

You can \\ngive the tip directly to your \\nwaiter/waitress or, more \\ncommonly, simply leave it on \\nthe table. Not leaving a tip is \\nfrowned upon and may earn \\nyou some unfriendly looks. \\nTipping is not common in \\nfast food restaurants (such \\nas McDonalds).

They will be present throughout the \\nsummer, but their numbers gradually diminish as the weather heats up.\\n2 Mosquitoes lay their eggs in calm water. You will therefore find more of them near wetlands, ponds \\nand streams.\\n3 Mosquitoes are much more active at dawn and at dusk than the rest of the day. Avoid walks in the \\nforest at these times.\\n4 Long-sleeved shirts and pants and light-coloured clothing are recommended.\\n5 Use a DEET-based mosquito repellent. Watkins is the most popular brand with Americans, and \\nthe most effective. Note that mosquito repellent creams and sprays have an expiration date. Most of \\nthem are only good for one year. You can buy mosquito repellent in any good pharmacy and even some \\ngrocery stores.\\n6 When enjoying outdoors activities, avoid wearing perfume or other sweet-smelling products which \\nmay attract mosquitoes.\\n7 Treat your clothing with a special insect repellent. The active ingredient absorbed into the fibres of \\nthe fabric evaporates very slowly, providing a more long-term protection.

That way, if you are stopped, \\nyou can be sure that the officer will be able to understand your legal \\ndocument.

       " Document(page_content='224\\nPRACTICAL INFORMATIONRoads in the U.S. are very well maintained and one of the \\nreasons for this is the tolls that are collected on many \\nhighways. When renting a vehicle, we recommend that you \\ncarry the equivalent of $25 in one-dollar and five-dol-\\nlar bills for easy payment at toll booths («toll plazas»). \\nPayment is in cash only for visitors, so you will have to \\npull into a lane where cash is accepted (do not stay in the \\nE-ZPass lane).\\nSo make sure you have a small amount of cash with you \\nwhenever you are driving somewhere.\\nBe aware that if you have to take a Turnpike, it means that \\nyou will pass at least one toll booth on your way.\\nYou can avoid these toll roads, but it will slow you down \\nconsiderably.\\nWAYS TO PAY HIGHWAY TOLLS\\nHighway toll changes are variable. Each toll plaza has several \\nbooths. Some self-service booths, clearly indicated, are re-\\nserved for vehicles with a card (E-ZPass or Express Pass, Sun \\nPass, etc.). This is probably not the case for you.\\nOther booths have toll operators who will take your payment. \\nAlways have cash in small denominations (no need for small \\nchange, they will give you change).\\nIn the eastern states, where there are more toll highways \\nthan in the rest of the country, some rental vehicles are \\nequipped with an automatic toll tag, which can be activated \\nor not. Ask about this when you pick up your vehicle.\\nIn the western states and Florida, vehicles with tags are less \\ncommon, but you can still ask the attendant at the counter \\nwhen you pick up your vehicle.\\nThe southern part of Florida (between Miami and Key West) \\nuses a fully electronic toll collection system, which means \\nthat there are no booths where you can pay cash. When you \\npick up your rental vehicle, you will be offered different pay -\\nment options so you won’t need to worry about navigating \\nFlorida’s toll roads. The payment will then be charged to your \\ncredit card. Ask at the rental office for more information.YOUR TOLL RECEIPT:\\nA USEFUL DOCUMENT\\nWhen you pay your toll, you may receive a \\nreceipt (not in all cases). The front of the \\nreceipt indicates the highway exit number, the \\nexit city, and the cost of the toll. On the back \\nof the receipt, you will find a list of highway \\nservice areas, their mile markers, and the \\nnames of the restaurants available there.\\nPASSING A TOLL BOOTH WITHOUT PAYING\\nNote that if you attempt to pass a toll booth \\nwithout paying, a photo of the vehicle’s li-\\ncense plate will be taken. A ticket will then be \\nsent to your rental company, which will charge \\nthe amount of the fine to your credit card \\nalong with an administration fee.\\nA list of toll roads in the United States is easy \\nto find online.
