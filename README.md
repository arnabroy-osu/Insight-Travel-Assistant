# Project3-Group3-Travel-Assistant
For this Final Project, we will work as a group to collaboratively solve or analyze a problem using advanced ML methodologies. We will incorporate transformer models, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and other tools acquired throughout the course, in addition to at least one new technology that we havenâ€™t covered together.

## Problem
The problem we are trying to solve is to create a travel assistant that can help users plan their trips. The travel assistant will be able to provide information on the weather, attractions, and restaurants in a given city. The assistant will also be able to recommend hotels and flights based on user preferences. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized recommendations for their trip.
